		Fused glass involve stacking, or layering thin sheets of glass, often using different colours to create patterns or simple images.<img class="before-image"src="wendy-images/before-lamp.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"> The stack is then placed inside the kiln and then heated through a series of ramps (rapid heating cycles) and soaks (holding the temperature at a specific point) until the separate pieces begin to bond together. <br><br>
The longer the kiln is held at the maximum temperature, the more thoroughly the stack will fuse, eventually softening and rounding the edges of the original shape. Once the desired effect has been achieved the kiln temperature will be brought down quickly to prevent the glass crystallising. <br><br>
<img class="after-image"src="wendy-images/after-lamp.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">The glass is then allowed to cool slowly over a specified time, soaking at specified temperature ranges to prevent uneven cooling and breakage and to ensure a strong finished product. This cooling takes place over a period of 10 to 12 hours in 3 stages. The glass remains in the closed kiln until it reaches room temperature.
